# Home K3s Cluster ‚Äî Infrastructure as Code

This repository defines the **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** setup for my intentionally over-engineered **K3s home cluster**.
It was built as a learning project to explore Kubernetes operations, but primarily serves to host personal workloads in a modular, automated, and reproducible environment.

The following tools form the foundation of the cluster's provisioning, configuration, and workload management:

## Core technologies

- **Ansible** ‚Äì Used to bootstrap nodes, install dependencies, and configure system-level settings before joining the cluster.
- ~~**Terraform**~~ **OpenTofu** ‚Äì Manages all cluster resources declaratively, including Helm releases, namespaces, secrets, and Argo CD applications.
- **K3s** ‚Äì A lightweight Kubernetes distribution optimized for edge and home lab setups.
- **Helm** ‚Äì Handles installation and configuration of complex applications via reusable charts.
- **Kubernetes Manifests** ‚Äì Define workloads, services, ingress rules, and other cluster resources in YAML.

Here‚Äôs your updated **Cluster Components** section with a short, natural mention of your MikroTik-based home network and the link to your router configuration:

## Cluster components

The cluster consists of three physical nodes:

- üêÆ **cow** ‚Äì Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM)
  Acts as the **control-plane** node, managing cluster state and system components.

- üêë **sheep** ‚Äì Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM)
  Serves as a general-purpose worker, running core services and lightweight workloads.

- ü¶Ü **duck** ‚Äì Lenovo ThinkCentre M910q (i7, 32GB RAM)
  Dedicated to AI workloads and compute-heavy tasks. Normally powered off and started on demand.

The cluster runs on my **MikroTik-based home network**. See the [network configuration and automation repository](https://github.com/Schwitzd/IaC-HomeRouter) for details.

## Networking

This cluster is configured as a **dual-stack environment**, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 across all components.  
While I don‚Äôt strictly need IPv6 in my home network, I saw it as a great opportunity to learn and experiment with it in a real-world setup.

The networking stack is built around **Cilium**, which is responsible for:

- Providing **Container Networking (CNI)** using **eBPF**
- Replacing **kube-proxy** with eBPF-based service routing
- Managing **LoadBalancer IPs**, removing the need for an external component like MetalLB
- Enforcing **Kubernetes Network Policies**

### Network architecture

All cluster nodes are connected to a dedicated VLAN with the following addressing:

- **IPv4:** `192.168.14.0/26`
- **IPv6:** `fd12:3456:789a:14::/64`

The node's primary IPs are explicitly specified using the `--node-ip` K3s installation flag to ensure dual-stack support.

The Kubernetes **Pod and Service CIDRs** are defined for both address families:

| Purpose          | IPv4 CIDR            | IPv6 CIDR                   |
|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Cluster Pods     | `10.42.0.0/16`       | `fd22:2025:6a6a:42::/104`   |
| Cluster Services | `10.43.0.0/16`       | `fd22:2025:6a6a:43::/112`   |

## Storage

Each Raspberry Pi in the cluster is equipped with a [Geekworm X1001](https://wiki.geekworm.com/X1001) M.2 HAT, providing fast local storage via NVMe SSDs. ¬†
These disks are pooled together using **Rook-Ceph**, which handles replication, failover, and enables PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to be shared across nodes.

I originally started with **Longhorn**, but after countless headaches with corrupted PVCs and unreliable volume detachment during shutdowns, I decided to switch to **Rook-Ceph**, which has proven far more stable and resilient ‚Äî even though it requires significantly more resources and can be a bit overwhelming for a Raspberry Pi-based setup.

## Deployment workflow

### Preparing the nodes

Before deploying any workloads, we first need to prepare the Raspberry Pi nodes to host the K3s cluster. Inside the `ansible/` folder, you'll find two playbooks that handle the required system configuration.

Install the necessary Ansible roles and collections in order to use the playbooks:

```sh
cd ansible
ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yaml --force
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yaml --force
```

#### Set up SSH passwordless authentication

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml ssh-auth.yaml --extra-vars "target=<node-name>" -u k3s -c paramiko --ask-pass
```

This playbook performs the following:

- Generates an SSH key pair on the local machine (if not already present)
- Copies the public key to the target node and appends it to its ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- Generates a temporary file in the directory `/tmp/<hostname-fqdn>_ed25519_passphrase.txt` that contains the passphrase

#### K3s pre-requirements

Next, we apply the system-level configuration required to run K3s on the Raspberry Pi nodes:

This playbook performs the following:

- Sets up and mounts a Btrfs volume for persistent storage
- Applies SSH hardening and restricts access to the `k3s` user
- Enables memory cgroups required by K3s
- Add third-party repositories for Helm and Kubectl, then install the required packages
- Configures K3s environment variables for image garbage collection
- Prepare disk device and kernel module required by Rook Ceph
- Sets up static IPv6 networking via NetworkManager
- Enables IPv6 forwarding for networking compatibility
- Deploys graceful shutdown and startup scripts + systemd units
- Configures and enables a cron job to automatically shut down the cluster safely

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml k3s.yaml --tag <tag-name>
```

Because the playbook `k3s.yaml` contains tasks that must be run before and after K3s installation, a controlled deployment is strongly suggested. Before installing K3s, run the following tags in order:

- sshd
- apt
- networking
- k3s-cgroup

Follow the [Installation](#installation) section to deploy K3s.  
Once K3s is installed, run the following Ansible tags in order:

- k3s-cilium
- k3s-rook-ceph
- k3s-post
- k3s-config, k3s-aliases
- shutdown-startup

Once Kubernetes has been installed and all the Ansible tags applied, we can start deploying resources to the cluster.

### Preparing OpenTofu

```sh
tofu init
tofu plan
```

## K3s

K3s is currently installed manually on each node using the official installation script. While automating this step with Ansible would be ideal, I opted for manual installation due to limited time and haven't yet explored what's already available in the community.

## Deploying resources

This section outlines the recommended order to deploy the **core services** into the K3s cluster. ¬†
Following this sequence ensures proper service dependencies and seamless integration between networking, ingress, and TLS management components.

Some critical components must be available before **Argo CD** is installed, to support this, they follow a **dual deployment strategy**:

 1. Temporarily deployed using OpenTofu.
 2. Later imported into Argo CD for full GitOps lifecycle management.

### Installation

The following sections outline how both the **control-plane** and **worker** nodes are installed using the official K3s script.

```
## Master node
export K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644"
export INSTALL_K3S_EXEC=" --disable-cloud-controller --disable=coredns --disable=servicelb --disable=traefik --secrets-encryption --flannel-backend=none --node-ip=<ipv4>,<ipv6> --cluster-cidr=<ipv4-range>,<ipv6-range> --service-cidr=<ipv4-range>,<ipv6-range> --kube-controller-manager-arg=node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6=120 --disable-network-policy --disable-kube-proxy --tls-san <cluster-fqdn>"

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="<desired-version>" sh

## Worker node
# Get the node token
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

# Installation
INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--flannel-backend=none --node-ip=<ipv4>,<ipv6>"

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="<desired-version>" K3S_URL=https://<RPI_NODE_HOSTNAME>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<NODE_TOKEN> sh -
```

While it's not best practice to manage the cluster directly from the **control-plane** node, I do so here for the sake of simplicity and ease of local development.

To streamline day-to-day operations, I configure `kubectl` on the **control-plane** like this:

```sh
# Set up kubectl config
mkdir -p ~/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
sudo chown $USER ~/.kube/config
sudo chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

# Optional: Enable kubectl autocompletion
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Once the **control-plane** node is installed, you will notice that it is in the `NotReady` state.This is expected, because no **CNI** is installed at this stage. To resolve this **Cilium** must be deployed to the cluster. But before doing this making sure that at least one **worker** node is already joined to the cluster so **Cilium** pods can be scheduled successfully.

First, go back to the [K3s Pre-requirements](#k3s-pre-requirements) section to provision the missing tags, then proceed with the deployment of **Cilium**.

### Secrets management

Secrets in my cluster are managed natively by K3s, using the `--secrets-encryption` flag during installation.
This flag enables **secret encryption at rest**, ensuring that all `Secret` resources are encrypted using AES-CBC with an auto-generated key stored on disk (typically at `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls`).

While this provides basic protection, it's important to understand the limitations:

- The encryption key is stored on disk, on the same machine as the data.
- Anyone with root access can potentially access and decrypt the secrets.
- Key rotation must be performed manually.

A more robust secret management system like Vault is on the roadmap.

### Networking with Cilium

Since **Cilium** is such a critical component of the cluster's networking stack, it must be deployed early in the cluster lifecycle, before any workloads or services can function properly.  
K3s is configured without a default CNI or kube-proxy, making the installation of Cilium the first essential step after setting up the nodes.

The deployment process follows the standard dual-step approach required when dealing with Kubernetes CRDs:

```sh
# Step 1: Install Cilium with CRDs
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=helm_release.cilium

# Step 2: Apply IPPool and L2 announcement CRs after CRDs are ready
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=kubernetes_manifest.cilium_ip
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=kubernetes_manifest.cilium_l2
```

> **Note**: `depends_on` is not sufficient in this case because OpenTOfu resolves CRDs during the planning phase ‚Äî not at apply time. This is why the manifests must be applied in a separate step after Cilium is installed.

After deploying **Cilium** itself, we apply the fundamental network policies to allow the core workloads (like DNS, Ingress, and cert-manager) to communicate successfully:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=kubernetes_manifest.network_policies
```

Once Argo CD is available, bring it under the management of GitOps, including the network policies:

```sh
# Cilium deployment in Argo CD
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.cilium

# Cilium network policies
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.cilium_policies
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep in mind:** at this stage, the previous command only allows fundamental policies that enable the core services of the cluster to communicate with each other. However, I expect that some **Cilium policy violations** will occur. Please refer to the troubleshooting section, [Cilium network policies](#cilium-network-policies), for guidance on identifying and resolving these issues.
In addition, at the time of writing, the Hubble UI primarily focuses on pod-to-pod traffic. Dropped traffic originating from the `host` or `remote-node` may not be visible in the UI. For full visibility, including host-level and remote-node policy drops, use the **Hubble CLI**.

The **Cilium CLI** is installed automatically on the **control-plane** node via a dedicated **Ansible role**, allowing easy access to status and observability features like `cilium status` and `cilium monitor`.

### CoreDNS

**CoreDNS** acts as the internal DNS server for service discovery and cluster DNS resolution in K3s. It is deployed automatically by K3s during cluster installation. However, this deployment method has limitations with regard to service customisation. The complex logic that I developed to shut down or restart the cluster requires a toleration to be added to **CoreDNS**. For this reason, I chose to install CoreDNS using the official Helm chart instead of the K3s installation script.

Once **Argo CD** is up, bring it under GitOps management:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=helm_release.coredns
```

Then import it into Argo CD:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.coredns
```

### Certificates

TLS certificate management in the cluster is handled by **Cert-Manager**. This setup supports two main scenarios:

- **Public domain certificates**: issues certificates signed for my public domain (via [DNS-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)) so I can securely access workloads within my home.
- **Internal self-signed CA**: a separate, private certificate authority (CA) is managed by **Cert-Manager** to encrypt internal service-to-service traffic within the cluster.

Due to how **OpenTofu** handles Kubernetes CRDs, you **must** install **Cert-Manager** and its CRDs first, then deploy the `ClusterIssuer` resource in a second step. **OpenTofu** can only resolve CRDs that exist at plan time, so this split is required.

To deploy **Cert-Manager** and the `ClusterIssuer` correctly:

```sh
# Step 1: Install Cert-Manager with CRDs
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=helm_release.cert_manager

# Step 2: Deploy ClusterIssuer (public domain) and the internal CA Issuer
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=kubernetes_manifest.le_clusterissuer
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=kubernetes_manifest.internal_ca_issuer
```

> **Note**: `depends_on` is not sufficient here because OpenTofu resolves CRDs during the planning phase, not at apply time.

Once **Argo CD** is running, bring **Cert-Manager** and `ClusterIssuer` resources under full GitOps management:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=argocd_application.cert_manager
```

#### Farm CA

Because the internal **Farm CA** (the cluster's private certificate authority) is managed by **Cert-Manager**, and many core services depend on it, it needs to be bootstrapped early in the cluster lifecycle.

1. Create the bootstrap `ClusterIssuer` by adding the file `clusterissuer-selfsigned-bootstrap.yaml` to the GitOps repo:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
    kind: ClusterIssuer
    metadata:
      name: selfsigned-bootstrap
    spec:
      selfSigned: {}
    ```

2. Apply the Farm CA using the ArgoCD application to trigger the deployment of the Farm CA manifests:

    ```sh
    tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=argocd_application.farm_ca
    ```

3. Wait until the Secret `farm-ca-keypair` appears in the `pki` namespace. This confirms the CA has been successfully created by cert-manager:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n pki get secret farm-ca-keypair
    ```

4. Remove the `clusterissuer-selfsigned-bootstrap.yaml` file and comment out the relevant line in the `kustomization.yaml` file in the GitOps repository.

5. Sync again with **Argo CD** to prune the now-unneeded bootstrap issuer from your cluster.

#### Trust Manager

**trust-manager** makes it easy to share your internal CA (`ca.crt`) with all workloads‚Äîsecurely and automatically. Instead of copying secrets (which may include private keys), **trust-manager** distributes only the CA certificate, following best practices and enabling safe rotation when your CA changes.

[Read more about why this separation matters in the official trust-manager docs.](https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/)

To deploy it with **Argo CD**:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=argocd_application.trust_manager
```

By default, **trust-manager** does **not** have access to secrets in all namespaces (you can probably guess why). You must explicitly specify which secrets it can manage. In this setup, I'm only allowing access to the `farm-ca-bundle`:

```yaml
secretTargets:
  enabled: true
  authorizedSecretsAll: false
  authorizedSecrets:
    - farm-ca-bundle
```

Also by default the ca secrets is created on every namespaces, since I don't need it on all I'm filtering with a label `farm/sync-ca: "true"` on which should be synched:

```yaml
apiVersion: trust.cert-manager.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bundle
metadata:
  name: farm-ca-bundle
  namespace: pki
spec:
  sources:
    - secret:
        name: farm-ca-keypair
        key: ca.crt
  target:
    secret:
      key: ca.crt
      metadata:
        labels:
          app.kubernetes.io/component: "trust-bundle"
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        farm/sync-ca: "true"
```

---

Additionally, trust-manager would (by default) distribute the CA secret to every namespace. To restrict this distribution, I use a namespace label, `farm/sync-ca: "true"` to control which namespaces receive the CA:

```yaml
apiVersion: trust.cert-manager.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bundle
metadata:
  name: farm-ca-bundle
  namespace: pki
spec:
  sources:
    - secret:
        name: farm-ca-keypair
        key: ca.crt
        namespace: pki
  target:
    secret:
      key: ca.crt
      name: farm-ca-bundle
      metadata:
        labels:
          app.kubernetes.io/component: "trust-bundle"
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        farm/sync-ca: "true"
```

### Ingress with Traefik

All services in the cluster are exposed externally through **Traefik**, which acts as the **Ingress Controller**.
**Traefik** is configured to use LoadBalancer IPs provided by **Cilium**, making the setup simpler and more integrated.

To deploy **Traefik** initially with OpenTofu:

Deploy **Traefik** with LoadBalancer configuration:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=helm_release.traefik
```

Later, import it into Argo CD:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.traefik
```

The diagram below illustrates how external traffic reaches workloads in the cluster using **Cilium** for LoadBalancer IP management and **Traefik** as the Ingress Controller:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph K3s Cluster
        direction TB
        Cilium[Cilium CNI & LB IPAM]
        Traefik[Traefik Ingress Controller]
        Pod1[App Pod 1]
        Pod2[App Pod 2]

        Cilium --> Traefik
        Traefik --> Pod1
        Traefik --> Pod2
    end

    Client[Client] --> VirtualIP[(Virtual IP)]
    VirtualIP --> Cilium
```

### Argo CD

**Argo CD** manages the desired state of all applications and infrastructure deployed to the Home K3s cluster, providing a GitOps workflow for automated and repeatable deployments.

**How Argo CD is Integrated**:

- **Project and App Management**: Each major category of workload (e.g., databases, observability, system, registry) is isolated into its own Argo CD Project for RBAC and resource scoping. Applications are registered declaratively using OpenTofu, referencing charts and values from either OCI Helm registries or private Git repos (maybe one day I will opensource it).

- **Secrets**: Sensitive values are never stored in Git. Instead, OpenTofu provisions all required Kubernetes Secrets before Argo CD syncs the relevant application. Charts are configured to reference these pre-existing secrets using their existingSecret fields wherever supported.

- **Automated Sync**: Most system and core workloads are set to sync automatically. Argo CD will monitor and automatically apply any updates to charts or values files, as well as self-heal if resources drift from the declared state.

To deploy **Argo CD**:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=helm_release.argocd
```

Then, create all Argo CD Projects and assign their associated repositories:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=argocd_project.projects
```

### Storage with Rook-Ceph

The default storage pool is named `haystack`, inspired by the idea of a place where valuable things are tucked away ‚Äî in this case, all the cluster's persistent data. This is where Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are stored and used by workloads that need to retain data across reboots.

Rook-Ceph is deployed using **Argo CD** and is composed of two main components:

- **The Operator**, which acts as a controller that manages the lifecycle of Ceph resources inside the cluster.
- **The Cluster**, which defines how Ceph itself is configured ‚Äî including monitors, OSDs, storage pools, and more.

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.rook_ceph_operator
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.rook_ceph_cluster
```

### Garage

I decided to switch from MinIO to **Garage** after [MinIO's removal of key features from the community edition](https://github.com/minio/object-browser/pull/3509). MinIO is following a "Redis momentum" and almost all functionality are now available only in the enterprise tier. At the time of writing, **Garage** does not offer a web UI and can only be configured from the command line interface (CLI), unlike MinIO, which had a really nice web UI.

The deployment uses the same Argo CD strategy, but **Garage** requires a cluster layout before storing data. I automated this step using a Kubernetes job that runs upon initial installation, detects the node ID, and applies the layout.

The plan is to automate the process of creating the buckets, which are currently created manually using the CLI inside the container. The goal is to find a Tofu provider to automate this task.

Since switching from Longhorn to **Rook-Ceph**, the other valid alternative is to use the integrated S3-compatible feature in the latter. However, using it requires additional containers with high resource requirements, which are currently overfilling my RPis, so I decided to use Garage instead.

### PostgreSQL with CloudNativePG

After Bitnami announced they would retire their community-maintained Helm charts and shift toward a commercial offering focused on secure, production-ready images ‚Äî [as detailed in this announcement](https://news.broadcom.com/app-dev/broadcom-introduces-bitnami-secure-images-for-production-ready-containerized-applications), I began searching for a Kubernetes-native alternative to manage my PostgreSQL databases.

That's when I discovered **[CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/)**: an open-source, CNCF-hosted operator built specifically for running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes.

What makes CloudNativePG great:

- **Kubernetes-native lifecycle management**: PostgreSQL clusters, users, databases, backups, failover behavior, and bootstrap scripts are all defined declaratively using Custom Resources (CRs).
- **Built-in high availability**: Supports multi-instance clusters with synchronous replication and automatic failover.
- **Self-healing**: Automatically promotes a new primary if the current one goes down.

Just like the rest of my stack, **CloudNativePG** is fully managed via Argo CD. It consists of two key components:

- **The Operator** ‚Äì Monitors and reconciles `Cluster` resources and automates the full PostgreSQL lifecycle.
- **The Cluster** ‚Äì A declarative resource that defines the PostgreSQL setup: replicas, storage, authentication, and init logic.

Deployment follows the usual pattern:

```sh
# Deploy the operator
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.cnpg_operator

# Deploy your PostgreSQL cluster
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.cnpg_cluster
```

### Observability stack

To keep an eye on the health, performance, and behavior of the farm (ehm, *cluster*), I use a classic combo: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for dashboards and visualization.

All dashboards are managed as code in my GitOps repo, and the Grafana dashboard sidecar auto-discovers and loads them into the UI. The connection to Prometheus as a data source is also defined and reconciled as code, making observability fully GitOps-managed, with Argo CD keeping it all in sync.

> Note: For each app you want to monitor, be sure to enable the relevant metrics exporter in its Helm charr. Otherwise, Prometheus won‚Äôt see any data for that workload.

#### Dashboards

| Name                  | Description                             | Grafana ID |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| grafana-dashboards-kubernetes | Set of dashboards for K8s     | [Github](https://github.com/dotdc/grafana-dashboards-kubernetes) |
| CloudNativePG          | The official CloudNativePG dashboard   | [20417](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/20417-cloudnativepg) |
| Cilium Metrics        | The Cilium Metrics official dashboard   | [21431](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/21431-cilium-metrics) |
| Traefik               | The Traefik Metrics official dashboard  | [17347](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/17347-traefik-official-kubernetes-dashboard/) |

### Other workflows

All other workloads in the cluster, including databases, observability tools, and supporting services follow the same deployment pattern:

They are defined as **Argo CD Applications** and deployed using the following command:

```sh
tofu apply --var-file=variables.tfvars --target=Argo CD_application.<app-name>
```

## Cluster SSH connection

In theory, connecting to a cluster over SSH should not be difficult, but connecting to this cluster is a bit tricky. The challenge is that a [systemd timer](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.timer.html) is executed daily to shut down the entire cluster (to avoid wasting electricity). The consequence is that if I'm connected to it and doing things, I get kicked out with a high risk of losing or corrupting the cluster. To solve this challenge, I added an `ssh-look` to the [shutdown logic](#shutdown). If it is present, the shutdown process is interrupted.

### SSH Login

To create the `ssh-look`, I'm leveraging [fish functions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html) by creating my klogin function in `.config/fish/functions/klogin.fish` (the Ansible task will follow).

```fish
function klogin
    if test (count $argv) -lt 1
        echo "Usage: klogin <host>"
        return 1
    end

    set -l host $argv[1]
    set -l fqdn "$host.schwitzd.me"
    set -l key  "$HOME/.ssh/$host.schwitzd.me_ed25519"

    # Run kubectl, then keep the session open with a login shell
    set -l remote_cmd "kubectl -n kube-system create ConfigMap ssh-lock-$host 2>/dev/null; exec bash -l"

    ssh -tt -i "$key" "k3s@$fqdn" -- "$remote_cmd"
end
```

This function does three things:

1. Connects to a remote node using a node-specific private key
1. Runs a kubectl command to create the `ssh-look` on that node
1. Drops you into an interactive login shell `bash -l`

### SSH logout

Logging out from the cluster simply reverts the login step. The `klogout` bash alias deletes the `ssh-lock` ConfigMap and then closes the SSH session.

## Cluster shutdown & startup workflow

This project implements a **role-aware, safe power cycle workflow** for the k3s cluster, designed to **reduce energy costs** by gracefully powering down all nodes when they are not needed‚Äîand reliably restoring full functionality at startup. Each node runs scripts generated by Ansible/Jinja2 with custom logic depending on its assigned role (`control-plane` or `worker`), ensuring no data loss and safe detachment of volumes during shutdown, as well as seamless, automated recovery during startup.

### Shutdown

The shutdown is a **coordinated sequence** led by the `control-plane` to ensure workloads stop cleanly.

1. **Coordination**
   The `control-plane` creates a shutdown lock ConfigMap in `kube-system`.
   `worker` nodes check for this lock and patiently wait, leaving orchestration to the `control-plane`.

2. **Silence ArgoCD**
   ArgoCD is scaled down before anything else. This prevents it from interfering with the shutdown by trying to immediately reconcile workloads.

3. **Shut down storage-dependent workloads in order**
   The `control-plane` handles workloads that rely on Rook-Ceph in a strict sequence:

   - First, applications labeled `storage=rook-ceph,shutdown=app` are scaled down.
   - Next, databases labeled `storage=rook-ceph,shutdown=db` are brought down.
   - Finally, the CloudNativePG cluster is annotated with `cnpg.io/hibernation=on`, and the script waits until all database pods terminate.

   This ensures applications stop before databases, and the database is fully hibernated before continuing.

4. **Clear the field**
   Once storage pods are gone and volumes detached, the shutdown lock is removed. At this point the cluster is ready for the final step.

5. **Drain and power off the node**
   Each node is tainted (`dns-unready=true:NoExecute`), cordoned, and drained to stop new workloads. The k3s service (`k3s` on control-plane, `k3s-agent` on workers) is stopped, and the system powers down.

### Startup

The startup process is coordinated by the `k3s-post-startup` systemd service, which ensures that workloads are scheduled only after the cluster is fully ready.

- **Startup Coordination:**

  - All nodes boot with the custom taint `dns-unready=true:NoExecute`, applied during shutdown to block early workload scheduling.
  - **CoreDNS** is configured to tolerate this taint and is allowed to start immediately.

- **DNS Readiness & Workload Restoration:**

  - The `k3s-post-startup` script waits until all **CoreDNS** pods are marked `Ready`.
  - Once DNS is confirmed operational:

    - The taint is removed from the current node.
    - The node is uncordoned, enabling workload scheduling.

- **control-plane logic**:

  - On the **control-plane** node, the script scales the **Argo CD Application Controller** back up, allowing reconciliation of all previously scaled-down workloads.

## Miscellaneous

### K3s CLI aliases

To simplify frequent Kubernetes cluster operations, the following shell aliases are included:

| Alias    | Command                                                                 | Description                                                      |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kwpods` | `watch kubectl get pods -A -o wide`                                     | Live-updating view of all pods (wide mode)                       |
| `kpods`  | `kubectl get pods -A -o wide`                                           | One-time snapshot of all pods (wide mode)                        |
| `koff`   | `sudo systemctl start k3s-graceful-shutdown@remove-ssh-lock.service`    | Trigger a graceful shutdown of the cluster                       |
| `klogin` | `kubectl -n kube-system create configmap ssh-lock-$(hostname) --from-literal=date=$(date -u +%F) --dry-run=client -o yaml \| kubectl apply -f -` | Create an SSH lock for the current node (local machine)          |
| `klogout`| `kubectl -n kube-system delete configmap ssh-lock-$(hostname) --ignore-not-found \; logout` | Remove the SSH lock for the current node and close SSH session |

### Naming convention

To ensure consistency, clarity and maintainability across the cluster, I will follow the naming convention for almost all resources that I create. This approach makes it easier to identify the purpose of each object at a glance.

Below is the naming schema used across the cluster:

| Resource Type ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | Format ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†  | Example ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Certificate (generic) | `tls-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `tls-dashboard` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† |
| Certificate (ingress) | `tls-<name>-ingress` ¬† ¬†| `tls-dashboard-ingress` |
| ClusterRole ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cr-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cr-read-only` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| ClusterRoleBinding ¬† ¬†| `crb-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `crb-admin-binding` ¬† ¬† |
| ConfigMap ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cm-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cm-grafana-dashboards` |
| CronJob ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cron-<task>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `cron-db-backup` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| Job ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `job-<task>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `job-schema-migration` ¬†|
| PVC ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `pvc-<app>-(<purpose>)` | `pvc-postgres-data` ¬† ¬† |
| Role ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `role-<name>` ¬†         | `role-system-metrics` ¬† |
| RoleBinding ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `rb-<name>` ¬† ¬†         | `rb-database-access` ¬† ¬†|
| Secret (auth) ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `auth-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `auth-admin` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| Secret (db auth) ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-db-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-db-postgres` ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| Secret (s3 auth) ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-s3-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-s3-backup`   ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| Secret (ssh auth)¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-ssh-<name>`  ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-ssh-router`  ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| Secret (api auth)¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-api-<name>`  ¬† ¬† ¬†| `auth-api-cloudflare`¬† ¬†|
| Secret (generic) ¬† ¬† ¬†| `secret-<purpose>` ¬† ¬† ¬†| `secret-foo`       ¬† ¬† ¬†|
| ServiceAccount ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†| `sa-<name>` ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† | `sa-argocd`     ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† |

A lot of resources are created by the corresponding Helm chart, and it is not possible to decide on a name, or it is too overwhelming to change it.

## Troubleshooting

### Cilium network policies

At the early stage of the cluster setup, **Hubble** (Cilium‚Äôs observability layer) is not yet deployed, so you won't be able to rely on its UI or CLI from outside the cluster.  
If a workload cannot be reached or network traffic is unexpectedly dropped, you can troubleshoot directly from the Cilium agent running on the affected node.

1. Identify the node where the workload is running:

  ```sh
  kubectl get pod -o wide -n <namespace>
  ```

2. Connect to the Cilium agent running on that node:

  ```sh
  kubectl -n kube-system exec -it cilium-<node-suffix> -- bash
  ```

3. Run Hubble locally to observe dropped packets:

  ```sh
  hubble observe --verdict DROPPED -f
  ```

  This will show you which flows are being denied by Cilium Network Policies.

Once **Hubble** is fully deployed in the cluster, troubleshooting becomes much easier. You can simply access the UI for a visual overview of network flows and dropped packets.

## Why share?

I'm sharing this repository because I believe in the value of **open knowledge**.
By open-sourcing my setup, I hope it can help others looking to automate their **home infrastructure** with **K3s, OpenTofu, Ansible**, and good **security practices** ‚Äî whether they're just learning or building something serious.

Collaboration and learning from each other is what makes the tech community thrive.

## Closing words

To be honest, I'm convinced that I would not have been able to achieve some of my goals without ChatGPT. At the very least, it would have required much more effort and time than I currently have with a small child.

Personally, I used ChatGPT for repetitive tasks and to generate code, as well as for troubleshooting. The latter was mainly due to laziness and the misguided belief that it would be quicker. This is not necessarily wrong, because it works perfectly in some cases. But at other times, I found myself going down a rabbit hole, with the LLM providing solutions that were hallucinatory. The lesson I have learned is that there comes a time when you have to stop using it, because a simple search of the official documentation or good old Stack Overflow is much faster!

This project has been a fun and rewarding challenge. I hope it inspires or helps others who are building their own home infrastructure. This won't be the end of my journey, as my to-do list is growing and cloud-native technologies are evolving incredibly quickly.

Stay curious üöÄ
